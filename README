Source code for led-keypad smart lock. Colors.py handles lighting the LEDs on the keypad while buttonScan.py handles checking for inputs from the user. Text.py is a text messaging file, sending the door owner a text when someone is attempting to open their door. Note for the file uploading to work the user must install the Dropbox-Uploader properly. Instructions are found here: https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader. Currently it is not possible to change the phone number to be texted because my cell phone number is attached to my Twillio trial account.
